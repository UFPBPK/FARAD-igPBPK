2.	Instructions on the model code

•	This instruction can be separated into three parts, including Part I: Model fitting; Part II: reproducing all results presented in the figures and tables in the manuscript and Part III: Run APP
•	Before you run all the codes, you need to check (1) R version (make sure the R version > 4.0) and (2) install some required packages: “FME”, “ggplot2”, “mrgsolve”, “dplyr”, “tidyr”, “patchwork”, “ggprism”.

2.1 Part I: Model fitting
•	Download the ‘Code_ModFit” folder 
•	Open the RStudio and set working directory as the directory where the folder ‘Code_ModFit’ locates.
•	Run the R code for model fitting: Open the R file “Modfit_FLO_Cattle” (you can choose different one with the name starting with “Modfit_..) and run all the code.
•	Get the results: After running all the code in the selected R file, the results of model fitting have been saved into R objects. For example, you can get the best parameters list if you run the code “exp(Fit_Cattle_FLO$par)”. You also can check the adjusted R-square by running the code “summary(fit)”. You also can check the Goodness-of-Fit plot for calibration data and evaluation data by run the code “p1” and “p2”. 

2.2 Part II: reproducing all results presented in the figures and tables in the manuscript
•	Download the ‘Code_Artwork” folder 
•	Open the RStudio and set the working directory as the directory where the folder “Code_Artwork” locates.
•	Open the R file “Figure_2.R” (you can choose any one you want to reproduce) and run all the code in the R file.
•	Get the results: After running all the code in selected “Figure_2.R” file, the figure will saved in the your working directory. For example, if you run the code “Figure_2.R”, the “Fig 2a. tiff”, “Fig 2b1.tiff”, “Fig 2b2.tiff” and “Fig 2b3.tiff” will save in your working directory.

2.3 Part III: Run App
•	Download the ‘Code_App” folder
•	Open the RStudio and set working directory as the directory where the folder ‘Code_App” locates.
•	Double click the ‘ui.R’ (or ‘sever.R’, either one is ok) in the app file to open the app in RStuido. 
•	Once you open the ‘ui.R’ file, you can click the “Run App” button at the upper right of window to run the app on your local computer. Note that if this is your first time to launch the App, it may ask you to install necessary packages, such as “extrafont” and “ggh4x”. To run the app in the web browser to avoid abnormal issues, please click the ‘Open in Browser’ button to run the app with the http format (it still runs locally). Please also refer to the Supplementary Data file for a step-by-step tutorial for this App.
